## Singly Linked List Practice Problems

In this section, exploring singly linked list by solving some problems. The problems are solved with C++.


### Find if a linked list is sorted in ascending order
**Problem:** Take a singly linked list as input and check if the linked list is sorted in ascending order.

See the [Linked List Sorted or Not](linked-list-is-sorted.cpp) for my solution approach.


### Insert in a linked list from multiple queries
**Problem:**  Take a singly linked list as input, then take q queries. In each query you will be given an index and value. You need to insert those values in the given index and print the linked list. If the index is invalid print “Invalid”.

See the [Insert queries at indexes](insert-queries-at-indexes.cpp) for my solution approach.


### Find middle element(s) from a linked list
**Problem:** Take a singly linked list as input and print the middle element. If there are multiple values in the middle print both.

See the [Find middle element](linked-list-find-middle-element.cpp) for my solution approach.
